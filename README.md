- __Contact__

  - This page will allow the user to get in contact with Hair by Ella regarding appointments, special pricing for wedding hair or for any other reason.
  - The contact form has five input areas. First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone Number and Details of your enquiry. The first four are mandatory fields as these are the most important fields required to know who has contacted. The details of your enquiry input area is not mandatory as this can be discussed between the user and Hair by Ella at a further stage.

### Features Left to Implement

- a future development idea would be to have a booking page where the user can pick an appointment date and time that suits.

### Unfixed Bugs

There were no unfixed bugs during development and testing. 

One issue that was encountered was when the opening times were part of the header. When using responsive design, they moved to an undesirable location on the page which caused a poor user experience. I resolved this by moving the opening times to the footer.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
